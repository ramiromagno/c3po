c3po is a documentation-only package for the journey from R to C and back again. Please note this is still a very much work in progress.

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ramiromagno/c3po")
```

## Usage

Browse the online documentation: https://rmagno.eu/c3po.

## Help

Help is emphatically appreciated! This package is at its infancy still, so if you feel like you can help documenting R's C API, please do. I will be glad to accept pull requests.
