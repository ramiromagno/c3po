c3po is a documentation-only package for the journey from R to C and
back again.

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ramiromagno/c3po")
```

## Example

To access the help page about the C function `Rf_ScalarReal`:

``` r

?Rf_ScalarReal
```

Browse the online documentation: <https://rmagno.eu/c3po>.

## Help

Help is emphatically appreciated\! This package is at its infancy still,
so if you feel like you can help documenting Râ€™s C API, please do. I
will be glad to accept pull requests.
